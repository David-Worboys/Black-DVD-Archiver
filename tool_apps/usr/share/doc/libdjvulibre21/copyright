The files doc/djvu{2,3}spec.djvu are documentation for the DjVu
format.  The original LaTeX sources for these documents has been lost.
It would be great if someone were to recreate it, rendering the
documents more tractibly modified and reformatted.

The files doc/lizard200{2,7}.{djvu,pdf} are legal documents related
to the freedom of this package itself, and hence need not themselves
be covered by a free license.
