 Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
 ------------------------------------
 .
 "These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM
 codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.
 .
 Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
 royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
 make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
 run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where
 such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
 Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
 infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
 that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
 implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
 or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
 enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
 counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM
 or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
 constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
 patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
 for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.

 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions by Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
 Still in the public domain.
