 This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
 no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
 unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
 configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
 Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
 the properties of the two independent implementations.
 .
 The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
 It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
 optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
 compile-time configuration.
