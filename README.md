# The Black DVD Archiver
The Black DVD Archiver is an application that will place user selected video files on a DVD and the source files in an archive location 
specified by the user. 

## Why Black? 
Henry Ford is reputed to have said "..You can have any colour you like as long as it is black" likewise you can have any DVD/Video settings you 
want in The Black DVD Archiver as long as they are the settings the author chose.

These settings are optimised at getting VHS, Beta and 8mm analogue video onto a DVD at the best possible quality that allows 2 hours to fit on 
a 4.7 GB disk.

The Black DVD Archiver is designed to do this task with the least amount of work by the user and to produce DVD's with a consistant menu layout
suitable for a collection.

Can the author be persuaded to be more flexible and add additional features? Possibly...with a very good reason.
