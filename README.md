# The Black DVD Archiver - Î²eta 1.0 Release
The Black DVD Archiver is an application that will place user selected video files on a DVD and the source files in an 
archive location specified by the user. 

## Why Black? 
Henry Ford is reputed to have said "...You can have any colour you like as long as it is black..." likewise, you can have 
any DVD/Video settings you want in The Black DVD Archiver as long as they are the settings the author chose.
 
These settings are optimised at getting VHS, Beta and 8mm analogue video onto a DVD at the best possible quality that 
allows 2 hours to fit on a 4.7 GB disk.

The Black DVD Archiver is designed to do this task with the least amount of work by the user and to produce DVD's with 
a consistent menu layout suitable for a collection.

Can the author be persuaded to be more flexible and add additional features? Possibly...with a very good reason.

## Features
* Selection Of Input Files In A Variety Of Container Formats - As Long As They Conform To PAL/NTSC standards
* A Simple Video Editor
* Limited Video Filters With Fixed Settings
* DVD's Have A Simplified Menu Structure
* Saves The Input/Ouput Files In A User-Selected Archive Folder. 
  * This Can Be Placed On A NAS And Accessed By A Media Player.
  * An ISO image of the DVD is produced so that DVD burning software can produce the physical DVD. 
    * Brasero is a good choice, choose the "Burn Image" option (https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Brasero)

## Why Archive To DVD?
In short, because DVD's are offline, they last, and they are easy to share.

SD cards, USB and Solid State Drives are not long term storage solutions because data stored on them is held in tiny 
cells as an electric charge that slowly leaks away.  

Similarly, Hard Disk Drives are not reliable because they are 
electromechanical devices with components that degrade over time even sitting on a shelf.  In fact, do not bet on more 
than 10 years from either, and I have seen both go bad in a lot less than that.

Offline magnetic tape storage can be long-lasting, if stored correctly, but requires specialised cassettes and drives. 
These maye be hard to source for individuals in decades to come.

Storing data in the cloud is betting on a companies' longevity, security, backup policies and continued support. It also 
depends on people passing on their login details after they die.

As a final note, archiving important material should be an in depth approach that utilises some of the above methods to 
avoid long term data loss, taking into account the deficiencies of each method. Offline optical disks (DVD/Blu-ray) are
the last best line of defence and the longest lasting and most accessible for individuals, particularly if neglected.

**Archiving for individuals** means a descendant can be digging through a hot dusty attic in say 50 years or a century 
and finding media that has retained data. 

Because DVD's are ubiquitous and held in official archives, it is highly likely a means can be found to play them or 
transfer their contents to future media for playback and sharing.

Successful consumer media playback and recording formats have very long lives, and because people collect them there is 
an incentive to find a way to play them back. Records, Cassettes, VHS, CD,  DVD and Blu-ray are all testaments to this.

Case in point VHS tapes, I have some now  over 40 years old and I can still play them. 

**Quality** DVD-R's/Blu-ray's burned correctly are the only media that an individual can rely on for long-term archiving 
today. I have some DVD-R's on a shelf behind me that are over 20 years old and test just fine.  I have CD-R that are 
over 25 years old and they test fine.  

## Points To Note
* PAL Specs - 720 W * 576 H, Aspect Ratio 4:3, 25 frames a second interlaced (50 fields a second)
* NTSC Specs - 720 W * 480 H, Aspect Ratio 4:3, ~30 (29.97) frames a second interlaced (60 fields a second)
* 16:9 Aspect ratio, usually from camcorders, uses the same resolution just remaps pixels from square to rectangular
* Interlaced videos are kept as interlaced. Resizing and deinterlacing are best left to the display device
* Only 4 GB Single Layer DVDs are supported as they are assumed to have the best archival qualities
* Supported Container Formats 
  * mp4, avi, mkv, vob,mod,mov,webm,m4v,3gp, 
    3g2, mj2,mkv,mpg,mpeg,ts, m2ts, mts,qt,

#### Video File Filters
* _Default Video Filters_ - These are the video filters applied by default to the project files.
In general, it is best not to filter unless absolutely  required as it takes time and can impact image 
quality. The settings chosen for these filters are aimed at having the minimal impact on video  quality

  * _Normalise_ - Attempts to bring out the shadow details
  * _Denaise_ - Applies a light noise filter to the video files (Can be slow)
  * _White Balance_ - Attempts to correct the white balance of the video files
  * _Sharpen_ - Applies a light sharpen to the luminance channel only
  * _Auto Levels_ - Attempts to brighten a video. If you need this then the video is likely to be of poor quality and 
  good results can not be expected.

DVD menu pages consist of a grid of image buttons with text placed on the bottom of each button image.

When video files are grouped or there are fewer button titles on the menu page than the grid allows for, then the
buttons are laid out in the most pleasing possible manner by an internal algorithm
